U-Boot modification for MT7621 Devices
==========
Forked from FireWRT Uboot @ commit 4f84dbda5ccb762d92e6c13196d55d64334628d7

Flashing the bootloader is risky.

If you like expensive bricks proceed without caution.

You will need a working Serial Console and a TFTP server.

From the Serial Console (UART) : Option 9

Please choose the operation:

   1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP.
   2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP.
   3: Boot system code via Flash (default).
   4: Entr boot command line interface.
   5: Load system code then write to Flash via Httpd.
   7: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via Serial.
   9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP.   <---<---
